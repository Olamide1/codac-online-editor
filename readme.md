# Codac Online Editor
---
 Its an Online Code Editor that's still in the works.

 ## Technology Used
 > HTML, Vanilla JS, CSS, and Pusher's Javascript Library

 its is still a basic editor at the moment, and is open for improvement and commits. 

 ## The pusher Javascript 
> is the library that allows for collaboration on the text editor, i.e Code can be shared or written and viewed real time.

It is hosted on Heroku and New functionalities would be appreciated.
